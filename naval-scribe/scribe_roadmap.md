# Naval Scribe — Flagship Roadmap

Naval Scribe is a graduated YOLO project operating under Flagship rules alongside Markdown Deck. Tock sessions alternate between the two flagships.

## Current State (v1.0 — 2026-04-02)

### Correspondence Types (7)
- [x] Standard Naval Letter
- [x] Memorandum
- [x] Endorsement
- [x] Business Letter
- [x] Point Paper
- [x] Action Memo
- [x] Memorandum of Agreement (multiple signers)

### Core Features
- [x] Form-based input with conditional field visibility per type
- [x] Live preview with proper naval formatting
- [x] .docx export via hand-rolled OOXML ZIP
- [x] Auto paragraph numbering (1. a. (1) (a))
- [x] SSIC field, DD Mon YYYY date format
- [x] Multi-entry Via/Ref/Encl fields
- [x] localStorage auto-save
- [x] Times New Roman 12pt, 1-inch margins

## Approved (Next Tock)

- [ ] Inline tables in body text — parse markdown-style tables and render in preview + .docx
- [ ] Paste-to-parse references — paste a block of references, auto-split into lettered (a), (b), (c) entries

## Parking Lot

- SSIC code search/lookup database
- Letterhead presets per command
- Second-page header continuation
- Classification marking toggle (UNCLASSIFIED/CUI)
- Endorsement chaining (append to existing letter)
